                      Mercury in Aries <img src="https://www.astro-seek.com/seek-images/seek-icons/horoskop-beran.gif"/> - People with Mercury in Aries do everything quickly and they sometimes say things without thinking. Their enthusiasm may be quickly replaced with an interest in a new thing or another exciting experience. It may seem to other people that there is a fire behind them that is forcing them to act fast. Mercury affects fiery signs by creating lively imps who are interested in anything that attracts their attention. Their mind is active and wants thoughts and words to become deeds. However, it is important to accept not only mental stimulation but also challenges, and acknowledge that it takes some time before an idea or goal can be realised.
